= Using a PCF8574 remote 8-Bit I/O expander over I2C to get more IO pins
:xrefstyle: short

This example demonstrates how to use the PCF8574 Remote 8-Bit I/O Expander with the Raspberry Pi Pico over the I2C bus. The code toggles the pins of the PCF8574 sequentially, turning them on and off one by one.
