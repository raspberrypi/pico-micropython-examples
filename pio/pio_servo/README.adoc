= Using PIO to drive a servo motor
:xrefstyle: short

Drive a servo motor by using two PIO statemachines for pulse output.

Each output needs a statemachine running servo_trigger and one running servo_prog.
Due to the IRQ assignments, the statemachines need to be in ordered to have the servo_trigger program first, e.g.:

```
trig = Servo_Trigger(0)                 # Statemachine 0
s = Servo(1, 16) # phys IO on pin 16    # Statemachine 1, since the trigger is on SM0

trig2 = Servo_Trigger(2)                # Statemachine 2
s2 = Servo(3, 25) # Builtin LED         # Statemachine 3, since the trigger is on SM2
```
